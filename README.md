# rumble-ios
iOS Client for Rumble News

# Getting Started
```sh
# Install cocoapods
sudo gem install cocoapods
git clone https://github.com/rumble-news/rumble-ios.git
cd rumble-ios
pod install

# Open the project in XCode. Use the .xcworkspace file instead of the
# .xcodeproj because the former knows more about the Pods.
open rumble.xcworkspace
```

Now you can run the app on your simulator.
